            Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease affecting the brain and spinal cord, collectively known as the central nervous system (CNS). 

            In people with MS, the communication of nerve impulses along nerve cells within the CNS is disrupted. This occurs when the protective layer (also called myelin) surrounding the nerve cells that normally speeds up transmission of nerve impulses is attacked by the immune system. 

            Repeated immune attacks can prevent the proper repair of myelin, and in some cases, cause damage to the nerve cells themselves, resulting in permanent injury to the brain and spinal cord.

            The nature and severity of symptoms vary from person to person. Even within the same individual, the characteristics of attacks (also known as relapses) can differ depending on which part of the CNS is being affected and the extent of myelin 
            and/or nerve cell damage.

            Relapses usually last for a couple of days to a week and are followed by an improvement in symptoms. Temporary worsening of signs and symptoms of MS can sometimes occur with a rise in body temperature (for example, during infections) but these do not count as a true relapse.
